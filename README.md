Given an array of temperatures of one day, calculate temperature amplitede.
An error might happen in readings also. This should be ignored.

- how to ignore errors
- find max number in array
- find min number in array
- subtract max and min numbers to get amplitude

- update function to receive two arrays and calculate amplitude of both of them combined
